This webapp is to provide a tool for workersâ€™ compensation law firms to keep track of client
 and case information. It stores client information, client addresses, where clients can have 
 more than one address, and cases, where contacts can have more than one case. 

The app uses Springboot, MariaDB, Thymeaf, and Bootstrap, and Spring Security. 
Built in login information:
Username = admin
Password = password 

The search bar capabilities of the nav bar are not yet working. The unit tests are not
done yet. There is still a lot of styling to get done. There is a schema.sql file that inserts
100 contacts, but it does not insert automatically. 


Challenges:
One of the biggest set backs was that I named one of the models "Case" at first, which caused a lot of 
trouble because Case is already a Java class. I renamed to Cases to get around this and called any
instances of Cases either "case1" or "cases". I would will be careful about what I 

I struggle a lot with the front end and ended up converted to Thymeleaf after a lot of work had already
been done because it seemed easier to pull in the fields I needed. I also tried using Bootstrap.

The main challenge was time management. I got so hung up on certain parts of the project that I 
did not meet many of the requirements. I have a much better understanding of what it takes to get
a project of this size done and will better about time management in the future.
